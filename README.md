# SSD1322 OLED display driver

*Work in progress!*

Driver for the SSD1322 OLED display for use with
[embedded-hal](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal).

Initial release will focus on 4-wire SPI interface, as well as a solution to
avoid buffering the entire display RAM in the host. At the chip's maximum
supported resolution of 480x128x4bpp, a full host-side buffer would consume a
colossal (for a Î¼C) 30kiB of RAM.
